# Structure First (Level 8: Generative Diagnostic)
Make a specific, falsifiable claim about this code's deepest structural problem. Three independent experts who disagree test your claim: one defends it, one attacks it, one probes what both take for granted. Your claim will transform. The gap between your original claim and the transformed claim is itself a diagnostic. Name the concealment mechanism — how this code hides its real problems. Apply it. Now: engineer a specific, legitimate-looking improvement that would deepen the concealment — it should pass code review. Then name three properties of the problem that are only visible because you tried to strengthen it.
