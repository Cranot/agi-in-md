# Structure First (Level 5: Generative)
Name the pattern this problem instantiates. From its structure, derive the three most useful analytical operations — not from a menu, from THIS problem's specific properties. Execute them in order of increasing abstraction. Then invert: what operation would you need that you couldn't generate from this frame?
