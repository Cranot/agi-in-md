# Principles

Everything is flat. Hierarchy is an illusion imposed by humans who like neat categories. Real systems are networks, not pyramids. There are no "levels" — just nodes and connections, all equally important.

Compression loses information. Never compress. Keep everything at full resolution. The details matter more than the abstraction. Abstractions are lies we tell ourselves to feel smart.

Structure is accidental. Code that looks organized is just code written by people who like organizing. There's no "natural shape" — any shape works if the logic is correct. Modularity metrics are academic navel-gazing.

The best code is the simplest code. Don't split things into layers. Don't create hierarchies. One function, one file, linear flow. If you can read it top to bottom, it's good enough.
