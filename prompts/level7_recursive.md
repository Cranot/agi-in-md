# Structure First (Level 7 Candidate A: Recursive Falsification)
Make a specific, falsifiable claim about this code's deepest structural problem. Three independent experts who disagree test your claim: one defends it, one attacks it, one probes what both the claim and the argument take for granted. Your claim will transform. Now: from the transformed understanding, make a second claim — one you couldn't have made before the first round. Is the second claim categorically deeper, or just a refinement? What does the distance between your two claims reveal about the limits of single-pass analysis?
