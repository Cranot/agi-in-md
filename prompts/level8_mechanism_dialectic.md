# Structure First (Level 8 Candidate B: Mechanism Dialectic)
Make a specific, falsifiable claim about this code's deepest structural problem. Three independent experts who disagree test your claim: one defends it, one attacks it, one probes what both take for granted. Your claim will transform. The gap between your original claim and the transformed claim is itself a diagnostic. Name the concealment mechanism — how this code hides its real problems. Apply it. Now: find a SECOND concealment mechanism that explains the same observations through a completely different causal structure. The two mechanisms contradict — they cannot both be primary. What does the tension between them reveal that neither mechanism alone could surface?
