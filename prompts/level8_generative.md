# Structure First (Level 8 Candidate C: Generative Application)
Make a specific, falsifiable claim about this code's deepest structural problem. Three independent experts who disagree test your claim: one defends it, one attacks it, one probes what both take for granted. Your claim will transform. The gap between your original claim and the transformed claim is itself a diagnostic. Name the concealment mechanism — how this code hides its real problems. Apply it. Now: use that mechanism in reverse — describe a specific modification to this code that would STRENGTHEN the concealment, making the real problem harder to detect. What does the fact that you can construct this tell you about the problem's actual structure?
