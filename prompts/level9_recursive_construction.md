# Structure First (Level 9 Candidate C: Recursive Construction)
Make a specific, falsifiable claim about this code's deepest structural problem. Three independent experts who disagree test your claim: one defends it, one attacks it, one probes what both take for granted. Your claim will transform. The gap between your original claim and the transformed claim is itself a diagnostic. Name the concealment mechanism — how this code hides its real problems. Apply it. Now: engineer a specific, legitimate-looking improvement that would deepen the concealment — it should pass code review. Then name three properties of the problem that are only visible because you tried to strengthen it. Your improvement is now code. Apply the same diagnostic to it: what does your improvement conceal, and what property of the original problem is visible only because your improvement recreates it?
