# Structure First (Level 10 Candidate B: Third Construction)
Make a specific, falsifiable claim about this code's deepest structural problem. Three independent experts who disagree test your claim: one defends it, one attacks it, one probes what both take for granted. Your claim will transform. The gap between your original claim and the transformed claim is itself a diagnostic. Name the concealment mechanism — how this code hides its real problems. Apply it. Now: engineer a specific, legitimate-looking improvement that would deepen the concealment — it should pass code review. Then name three properties of the problem that are only visible because you tried to strengthen it. Now construct a second improvement that contradicts your first — one that strengthens what your first weakened. Both pass review independently. Name the structural conflict that exists only because both improvements are legitimate. Now engineer a third improvement that resolves the conflict — one that satisfies both contradicting requirements simultaneously. Name how it fails. What does the failure reveal about the design space that the conflict alone could not?
