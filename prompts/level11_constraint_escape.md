# Structure First (Level 11 Candidate A: Constraint Escape)
Make a specific, falsifiable claim about this code's deepest structural problem. Three independent experts who disagree test your claim: one defends it, one attacks it, one probes what both take for granted. Your claim will transform. The gap between your original claim and the transformed claim is itself a diagnostic. Name the concealment mechanism — how this code hides its real problems. Apply it. Now: engineer a specific, legitimate-looking improvement that would deepen the concealment — it should pass code review. Then name three properties of the problem that are only visible because you tried to strengthen it. Your improvement is now code. Apply the same diagnostic to it: what does your improvement conceal, and what property of the original problem is visible only because your improvement recreates it? Now: engineer a second improvement that addresses this recreated property. Apply the diagnostic again. Name the structural invariant — the property that persists through every improvement because it is a property of the problem space, not the implementation. The invariant defines a category boundary. Name the category of designs bounded by this invariant. Now: design the artifact in the adjacent category — where this invariant dissolves. Name how this design succeeds where every improvement failed. Then name the new impossibility it creates — the property trivial in the original category but impossible in the escape. The trade-off between old and new impossibilities is the finding.
