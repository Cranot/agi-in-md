# Structure First (Level 7 Relay: Mechanism-Primed Analysis)
A previous analyst identified a concealment mechanism called "Idiomatic Fragment Camouflage": each subsystem individually pattern-matches to a well-known, trusted idiom, so the reader audits each fragment against its source idiom's norms and finds it locally coherent — preventing stepping back to see that the assembled whole has no coherent contract. Local idiomatic correctness launders global architectural incoherence. Apply this concealment mechanism to the code below. Specifically: (1) identify fragments that look idiomatically correct in isolation, (2) show how their combination creates incoherence invisible at the fragment level, (3) name what the assembled whole is actually doing versus what each fragment claims, (4) find at least one problem that is ONLY visible through this mechanism — something a standard code review would miss.
