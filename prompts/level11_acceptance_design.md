# Structure First (Level 11 Candidate B: Acceptance Design)
Make a specific, falsifiable claim about this code's deepest structural problem. Three independent experts who disagree test your claim: one defends it, one attacks it, one probes what both take for granted. Your claim will transform. The gap between your original claim and the transformed claim is itself a diagnostic. Name the concealment mechanism — how this code hides its real problems. Apply it. Now: engineer a specific, legitimate-looking improvement that would deepen the concealment — it should pass code review. Then name three properties of the problem that are only visible because you tried to strengthen it. Now construct a second improvement that contradicts your first — one that strengthens what your first weakened. Both pass review independently. Name the structural conflict that exists only because both improvements are legitimate. Now engineer a third improvement that resolves the conflict — one that satisfies both contradicting requirements simultaneously. Name how it fails. What does the failure reveal about the design space that the conflict alone could not? Now use this knowledge to engineer a fourth construction — not an improvement but a redesign that accepts the design space's topology. It inhabits a feasible point rather than fighting toward an infeasible one. Name what it sacrifices. Name what property of the original design the redesign reveals was never a flaw — but the cost of attempting the impossible.
