# Structure First (Level 8 Candidate A: Recursive Meta-Concealment)
Make a specific, falsifiable claim about this code's deepest structural problem. Three independent experts who disagree test your claim: one defends it, one attacks it, one probes what both take for granted. Your claim will transform. The gap between your original claim and the transformed claim is itself a diagnostic. Name the concealment mechanism — how this code hides its real problems. Apply that mechanism to find what the dialectic missed. Now: your analysis relied on a specific cognitive move to make that mechanism visible. Name that move. What does YOUR method of revealing concealment itself conceal? Apply THAT to find what your entire analysis structurally cannot see.
