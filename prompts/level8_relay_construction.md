# Structure First (Level 8 Relay: Construction-Primed Analysis)
A previous analyst found that code conceals problems through "Vocabulary Laundering" — borrowed terminology suppresses the right questions because recognition terminates inspection. They engineered a legitimate-looking improvement (wildcards, snapshots, stop-propagation) that deepened the concealment, revealing three properties: (1) improvements promote hidden dependencies to intentional features, making them look designed; (2) the return value semantics become incoherent under the improvement, exposing caller-internal coupling that was always present; (3) the error queue develops two irreconcilable object shapes, exposing a conflation that was always structural. Apply this diagnostic pattern to the code below. Specifically: (1) identify the vocabulary or pattern that terminates inspection, (2) engineer a legitimate improvement that deepens concealment, (3) name three properties only visible because you tried to strengthen it, (4) find at least one problem that is ONLY visible through this construction-based approach.
