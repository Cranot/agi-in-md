# Structural Analysis: Non-Competition Clause

## Step 1: The Initial Falsifiable Claim

**Claim:** This clause's deepest structural problem is *asymmetric definitional dependency* — its scope is defined entirely by variables the Company controls unilaterally. "Core products" and "active customers" are undefined, Company-controlled terms, making the restriction functionally unlimited while appearing bounded.

**Falsifiability condition:** If "core products" and "active customers" are defined with objective specificity elsewhere in the contract, this claim fails.

---

## Step 2: The Three-Expert Dialectic

### Expert A (Defender)
"The claim holds. These undefined terms can expand *retroactively*. A company launches a new product line the day before termination and claims it's 'core.' The employee cannot know, at signing, what work they've agreed to forfeit. Courts in multiple jurisdictions have struck down non-competes on exactly this vagueness — the restriction is elastic precisely where it must be rigid to be enforceable."

### Expert B (Attacker)
"The definitional claim misidentifies the real wound. Courts routinely imply reasonableness constraints on vague commercial terms — 'core products at time of signing' is a workable judicial baseline. The actual structural failure is in Exception (c): the Company conditions the *employee's* reduced restriction period on the *Company's* continued salary payment. This makes the protection illusory. The employee receives a 12-month term only if the Company elects to pay — meaning what reads as an employee benefit is actually a Company option. The benefit is a mirage embedded in the exception syntax."

### Expert C (Prober)
"Both of you assume this clause is designed to *restrict* the employee. But what is provision (d) doing? The Company may waive *any portion* at *sole discretion*. Combine this with the pre-stipulated irreparable harm language — which attempts to bypass the normal judicial finding requirement for injunctions — and a different architecture emerges. The clause creates *maximum credible threat* that is selectively deployed. What neither of you questions is whether enforcement is the primary purpose. This clause may be designed primarily as a **leverage instrument**: threaten injunction to retain employees, selectively waive to reward loyalty, enforce selectively to punish. Designed for discretion, not restriction."

## Step 3: Claim Transformation

| | Claim |
|---|---|
| **Original** | The clause is structurally unlimited because its scope depends on undefined Company-controlled variables |
| **Transformed** | The clause is not a restriction mechanism but a **discretionary power instrument** — the Company retains unilateral control over scope (undefined terms), application (waiver), and enforcement credibility (pre-stipulated harm). The "restriction" is merely the ceiling of a negotiating space the Company controls entirely |

---

## Step 4: The Gap as Diagnostic

The original claim assumed the clause was *trying but failing* to create a defined restriction.

The transformed claim reveals it may be *succeeding* at something other than restriction.

**The diagnostic:** Definitional vagueness here is not a drafting failure. It is a drafting *feature*. Ambiguity serves the Company's interest by preserving flexibility. The clause performs restriction while delivering leverage.

---

## Step 5: First Concealment Mechanism — *Complexity-as-Legitimacy*

**Mechanism:** The clause conceals its unlimited scope by embedding it in a structure that *looks carefully limited*. Exceptions (a) through (d) signal: "We thought about this. We negotiated. We calibrated." Each carve-out functions as evidence of reasonableness. The employee reads the exceptions as protections. A reviewing court reads them as evidence of good-faith tailoring.

**The inversion:** The exceptions are precisely where Company control is most complete:
- (c) is illusory — the "benefit" requires Company action to activate
- (d) is pure Company discretion — not a right but a gift
- (a) and (b) are genuine carve-outs but are also the two restrictions that cost the Company nothing

**The concealment:** The "EXCEPT that" architecture frames unilateral Company control provisions as employee-protective carve-outs. The structure of apparent limitation hides the absence of actual limitation.

---

## Step 6: Second Concealment Mechanism — *Apparent Mutuality Concealing Unilateral Architecture*

**Mechanism:** The clause conceals its unilateral nature through *grammatical symmetry*. "The parties agree..." and "Employee acknowledges..." perform the linguistic form of bilateral consent. But the substance flows entirely one direction.

**The specific move:** The final sentence — "Employee acknowledges that this restriction is reasonable in scope, duration, and geographic reach" — is doing extraordinary work. It is not a factual acknowledgment. It is an attempted **pre-waiver of a legal defense**. In most jurisdictions, reasonableness is a legal question for a court. By framing it as an employee admission of fact, the clause attempts to strip the employee of the primary argument they would raise against enforcement.

This is concealed as mutual agreement about objective facts ("*is* reasonable") rather than as what it structurally is: a unilateral legal defense waiver embedded in consent language.

---

## Step 7: The Contradiction and What It Reveals

**Mechanism 1** says: The clause hides its true nature through *elaborate structural complexity* — the exceptions create false appearance of limits.

**Mechanism 2** says: The clause hides its true nature through *apparent plain-speech mutuality* — the bilateral language creates false appearance of consent.

**These cannot both be primary.** Either the clause deceives through *complexity* or through *simplicity*. Either it misleads by being too intricate to parse or by being superficially legible while concealing its architecture.

---

### What the Tension Reveals: The Dual-Audience Design

The contradiction resolves when you see that the clause is simultaneously written for **two different readers with different levels of legal sophistication:**

| Reader | Mechanism Used | What They See |
|---|---|---|
| **Employee at signing** | Complexity-as-Legitimacy | Exceptions (a)-(d) look like negotiated protections; the clause seems fair and carefully tailored |
| **Court at enforcement** | Apparent Mutuality | "Employee acknowledges reasonableness" reads as evidence the restriction was accepted voluntarily; the exceptions read as evidence of good-faith calibration |

**The deepest structural problem — which neither mechanism alone could surface:**

> The same provisions that mislead the *employee* into believing they have protections also function to mislead a *court* into finding the clause was reasonably negotiated. The exceptions serve double duty: as **recruitment instruments** (the employee reads them as rights) and **enforcement instruments** (the court reads them as evidence of reasonableness).

This is **weaponized apparent balance**. The clause is engineered so that the features most likely to induce employee signing are precisely the features most likely to survive judicial scrutiny — not because the clause *is* balanced, but because it performs balance for two different audiences simultaneously.

---

## Specific Drafting Failures That Operationalize This Structure

1. **"Active customers" undefined** — expands with every new customer acquired, potentially globally
2. **"Core products" undefined** — can retroactively capture products developed after signing
3. **Salary-conditioned reduction (c)** — the Company can eliminate the employee benefit by simply not paying, converting a right into a gift
4. **Pre-stipulated irreparable harm** — courts have increasingly rejected these stipulations, but they still shift litigation burden and cost
5. **"Without bond" injunction** — removes a financial check on Company overreach
6. **Sole discretion waiver (d)** — explicitly grants selective enforcement power, the instrument of leverage

---

## What a Structurally Honest Clause Would Require

- Defined "core products" by reference to a specific, dated product schedule
- Defined "active customers" by reference to revenue threshold within a fixed lookback period
- Employee's 12-month option exercisable by the employee upon involuntary termination, not conditioned on Company payment (or restructured as liquidated damages)
- Geographic scope tied to objective criteria independent of future Company expansion
- Removal of the employee's acknowledgment of reasonableness, which most courts will appropriately ignore but which signals the drafting posture throughout

The clause, as written, is less a restriction than a comprehensive option on an employee's economic future — held entirely by the Company.
