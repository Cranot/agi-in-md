# Structural Diagnostic: Non-Compete Clause

---

## I. The Falsifiable Claim

**The deepest structural problem:** The clause performs legal precision — through specific numbers (24 months, 12 months, 2%) — while leaving its operative scope terms entirely undefined, producing a structure where the *measurements are exact and the thing being measured doesn't exist*. The employee acknowledges reasonableness of a scope that is, at the moment of signing, indeterminate.

This is falsifiable: if "core products" and "active customers" have sufficiently determinate meanings at signing, the claim fails. If they don't, every other provision is operating on a void.

## II. Three Experts Debate

**Expert A (Defends):** The reasonableness acknowledgment in the final sentence is the structural bomb. Courts retain authority to independently assess reasonableness — but a signed acknowledgment, especially combined with the irreparable harm clause, creates litigation asymmetry. The employee faces injunctive relief *without bond* based on a pre-signed concession. That's the load-bearing defect.

**Expert B (Attacks):** Courts almost universally disregard boilerplate reasonableness acknowledgments — they apply the blue-pencil or reformation doctrine independently. The acknowledgment is noise. The actual structural defect is simpler and worse: there is no definition of "core products." You cannot identify a breach. You cannot plan compliance. An unbreachable contract isn't protective — it's just a threat.

**Expert C (Probes what both take for granted):** Both of you assume this clause is attempting to be enforceable. What if enforceability is irrelevant to the clause's function? A clause that can *never be parsed into definite compliance* operates as a permanent behavioral tax on the employee — chilling effect without enforcement. You're both analyzing a legal instrument. Consider analyzing a power instrument. The structural problem may not be a defect in drafting. It may be the design.

## III. The Claim Transforms

**Original claim:** The clause has a self-defeating reasonableness acknowledgment that attempts to pre-empt judicial review.

**Transformed claim:** The clause is engineered for **deterrence through cultivated ambiguity**. The apparent defects — undefined scope, overbroad geography, elastic exceptions — are not failures of drafting. They are features. The clause optimizes for behavioral control, not legal enforcement.

**The gap between claims:** I initially analyzed the clause as a legal mechanism with structural flaws. The transformed claim reveals it as a behavioral instrument in legal clothing. The gap is between *what it purports to be* and *what it does*.

## IV. The Concealment Mechanism

**Definitional Deferral via Numerical Precision:**

The clause deploys exact numbers — 24 months, 12 months, 2%, written notice — to simulate rigor and craftsmanship. These numbers anchor the reader's attention, signaling that careful lawyers constructed this. The precise quantities make the missing definitions invisible by contrast. 

The structure is: *measure precisely → omit the unit.*

"Twenty-four months" is exact. "Core products" is a void. "Any geographic market where the Company has active customers" has no lower bound — one customer in Tokyo means Tokyo is covered. The precision is a distraction mechanism.

## V. A Legitimate-Looking Improvement That Deepens the Concealment

**Proposed Improvement — Definition Appendix:**

> "Core Products" means any product or service that (i) generates more than 10% of Company's annual gross revenue as of Employee's termination date, as reflected in the most recently available audited financial statements, or (ii) is in active development and reasonably anticipated by Company's Board to meet the 10% threshold within twenty-four (24) months of Employee's termination date.

**Why this passes code review:**
- Adds objective threshold (10% revenue)
- References verifiable documents (audited financials)
- Sounds like disciplined drafting

**Why this deepens the concealment:**

This definition resolves the surface void while creating a deeper one. It looks like a fix.

## VI. Three Properties Only Visible Because We Tried to Strengthen It

**1. Temporal Recursion**

The 24-month restriction period now exactly mirrors the 24-month development pipeline coverage. The clause covers whatever the Company will build during the exact period the employee is restricted. The restriction expands in step with Company ambition. This was invisible in the original because there was no definition to compare against.

**2. Authority Asymmetry Made Explicit**

The improvement reveals that scope is now determined entirely by Company-controlled documents (audited financials, Board determinations). The Company controls the instrument that measures the Company. The original clause obscured this by simply leaving scope undefined. The definition makes the circular authority visible.

**3. Definitional Recursion**

Every defined term creates new undefined terms. "Active development" is now undefined. "Reasonably anticipated" is a Board judgment standard with no review mechanism. "Annual gross revenue" requires a revenue recognition policy. The improvement reveals the clause's **irreducible definitional regression** — each layer of precision exposes a new layer of vagueness beneath it.

---

## VII. The Improvement as Code: Diagnostic Applied

**What the improvement conceals:**

The 10% revenue threshold can be satisfied or avoided by corporate restructuring prior to termination — splitting product lines, consolidating revenue centers, reclassifying products. More critically: the "in development" prong governed by Board determination is entirely non-justiciable. No court can second-guess whether a Board "reasonably anticipated" a product would reach 10% of revenue.

**What property of the original problem is visible only because the improvement recreates it:**

**Definitional recursion** — the invariant that any attempt to define scope in a non-compete requires delegating definitional authority to the party with an incentive to expand scope. The improvement makes this visible by naming the authority (the Board) that was previously hidden behind the undefined term "core products."

---

## VIII. Second Improvement: Address the Recreated Property

**Proposed Second Improvement — Schedule A (Fixed Product List):**

> "Core Products" means specifically the products and services listed in Schedule A attached hereto, as may be amended by Company upon sixty (60) days' written notice to Employee, provided that no amendment shall add products or services to Schedule A during any restricted period already in effect.

**Why this looks better:**

- Provides a concrete reference document
- Limits retroactive expansion during active restrictions
- 60-day notice period looks employee-protective

**What the second improvement conceals:**

The proviso "during any restricted period already in effect" is triggered only once restriction begins — but Schedule A can be expanded aggressively *before* termination, anticipating competitor employment. The notice mechanism creates a false sense of procedural protection while permitting pre-termination scope expansion.

**What property of the original problem is visible only because the second improvement recreates it:**

**Temporal instability** — the clause's scope cannot be fixed at the moment of signing because it depends on future documents. The employee's reasonableness acknowledgment is therefore made against a scope that does not yet fully exist. Every improvement either front-loads this instability (fix scope at signing, scope becomes obsolete) or back-loads it (allow dynamic scope, Company controls it). The second improvement makes this fork explicit and reveals there is no third option within the existing drafting paradigm.

## IX. The Structural Invariant

> **In any non-compete clause, the scope of restriction must be defined by the restricting party, who has a structural incentive to expand that scope, which means any definition of scope is simultaneously a delegation of definitional authority to the party with incentive to abuse it.**

**This persists through every improvement because it is a property of the problem space:**

| Drafting Choice | Result |
|----------------|--------|
| Fix scope precisely at signing | Scope becomes obsolete as business evolves; Company seeks reformation |
| Allow dynamic scope (schedule, board determination) | Company controls scope during restriction period |
| Delegate scope to courts | Employee bears full litigation cost to establish compliance |
| Leave scope undefined | Chilling effect without enforceable obligation |

**Every path reinstantiates the same invariant:** the party defining the boundary gains from the boundary's expansion. No drafting technique can neutralize this because it is not a drafting problem. It is an adversarial structure problem.

The clause cannot be fixed. It can only be renegotiated into a different structure — one where scope is determined by a neutral party at signing (arbitrator, regulatory standard, industry definition) — or it can be recognized for what it structurally is: a power asymmetry laundered through legal precision.
