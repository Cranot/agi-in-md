# Structural Diagnosis: The Non-Compete Clause

## Step 1: The Initial Falsifiable Claim

**Claim:** The deepest structural problem is that the geographic scope — *"any geographic market where the Company has active customers"* — is a **floating post-hoc definition**. It is determined entirely by Company behavior after signing, meaning the Employee binds themselves at formation to an obligation whose perimeter doesn't exist yet and can expand indefinitely. This makes the entire covenant legally indeterminate at the moment it is created.

This is falsifiable: if a court finds "markets where the Company operates" sufficiently definite, the claim fails.

## Step 2: The Dialectic

### Expert A (Defender)
The claim is substantially correct. Geographic definiteness is a primary enforceability test in most jurisdictions. A covenant whose scope is controlled entirely by the *obligating party's own subsequent business decisions* — expanding to Tokyo after you sign effectively restricts your mobility in Tokyo retroactively — violates basic formation doctrine. The employee cannot assess consideration, risk, or alternatives against an unknown perimeter. Courts in Delaware, New York, and most other commercial jurisdictions have invalidated scope-by-company-conduct language precisely because it transfers definitional power post-execution. The floating geography is the load-bearing defect.

### Expert B (Attacker)
Geographic scope is the **obvious surface defect** — the one any competent attorney immediately challenges, which makes it the *least* dangerous problem. Many courts, especially in federal circuits dealing with tech and national businesses, have enforced "wherever we do business" language. More importantly: focusing on geography entirely misses the **asymmetric optionality architecture**:

- Clause (c): Employee's only relief from 24→12 months requires the Company to keep paying salary — at the Company's practical discretion
- Clause (d): Company can waive *any* restriction at *sole discretion* with no Employee equivalent
- The injunctive relief clause waives the bond requirement, meaning the Company can enjoin the Employee's livelihood with zero financial skin in the game

The geographic argument is a red herring that conceals the real structure: **the Company holds all release valves while the Employee holds none.**

### Expert C (Prober — what do both take for granted?)
Both experts are asking the same question: *Is this enforceable?* Both assume this document's primary function is legal enforcement.

**What both take for granted:** That this clause is a failed attempt at a good contract, rather than a successful attempt at something other than a contract.

What if this clause is not designed to be *enforced* but to be *feared*? The geographic vagueness, the undefined "core products," the injunctive relief without bond — these don't just happen to chill employee mobility. They are structurally optimal for chilling it. An employee leaving a job cannot afford litigation even against an unenforceable clause. The *"Employee acknowledges this restriction is reasonable"* language isn't primarily evidentiary — it's psychological. It manufactures the employee's felt obligation independent of legal validity.

The enforceability debate is exactly what this clause wants you to have.

## Step 3: The Transformed Claim

**Original claim:** *The geographic scope is legally indeterminate, creating an unenforceable covenant.*

**Transformed claim:** *The clause is structurally optimized to function through its legal defects, not despite them. Ambiguity, undefined terms, and asymmetric control are the mechanism, not the malfunction.*

---

## Step 4: What the Gap Reveals — The Concealment Mechanism

The gap between these two claims is significant and diagnostic.

The original claim analyzed this as a **legal instrument measured against enforceability standards**. That framing is exactly what the clause imposes on its reader. By presenting itself in dense legal form — defined terms, numbered exceptions, explicit acknowledgments — it recruits the reader into a particular interpretive mode: *find the defects, test enforceability, propose revisions*. It presents as a flawed contract when it may be an effective control mechanism.

**The concealment mechanism is: Legal Form as Epistemic Frame.**

The scaffolding of legal language — the "EXCEPT THAT," the "PROVIDED THAT," the "at its sole discretion" — does not merely allocate rights. It directs analytical attention toward internal consistency and enforceability, away from the question of *what this clause is actually doing in the world*. Legal form creates a category error: we treat a behavioral modification tool as a drafting problem.

## Step 5: What the Entire Dialectic Failed to Surface

Applying the concealment mechanism to itself: if legal form conceals non-legal function, what is the clause doing that no one in the dialectic — defender, attacker, prober — examined?

**The asymmetric epistemic condition at formation.**

Every expert assumed the Employee has some capacity to assess what they're agreeing to. But examine what "core products" and "active customers" and "proprietary information" all have in common: **they are defined entirely by Company knowledge the Employee does not have access to at signing and cannot acquire.**

- *Core products*: undefined. The Company decides retrospectively.
- *Active customers in any geographic market*: the Employee cannot audit this. The Company controls this information.
- *Proprietary information* in clause (b): the Company determines what's proprietary after the fact.
- *Involuntary termination without cause* in clause (c): the Company controls the categorization of termination.

The employee is not signing a contract with a defined scope. **They are signing a blank check denominated in their own future mobility, where the amount is filled in later by the party holding the pen.**

The "Employee acknowledges this restriction is reasonable" clause is now fully legible: it extracts an acknowledgment of reasonableness from someone who *cannot yet know what they are acknowledging*. The acknowledgment is real; its object is not. This is not manufactured consent over a known thing — it is consent manufactured *precisely because the object is unknown*.

**The dialectic's collective blind spot:** All three experts treated this as a power imbalance problem — who controls the release valves, who can enforce, who can waive. Power imbalance is visible. What remained invisible is the **epistemic imbalance** underneath it: the Employee cannot know, at signing or after, the actual boundaries of the obligation they have undertaken, because those boundaries live entirely inside the Company's information and discretion.

This is what the clause is concealing: **not just that the Company has power, but that the Employee is structurally incapable of knowing what they owe.** Indefiniteness isn't a drafting error here. It is the product.

## Summary Table

| Layer | Claim | What's Wrong |
|---|---|---|
| Surface | Geographic scope is legally vague | True but trivially challengeable |
| Structural | Asymmetric release mechanisms | True but still in enforceability frame |
| Functional | Clause operates through deterrence, not enforcement | Reframes the question |
| Concealment | Legal form recruits enforceability analysis | Mechanism identified |
| Hidden core | Employee cannot know the scope of their obligation at formation; acknowledgment of reasonableness is consent to an unknown object | Never surfaced |

The real problem isn't that this contract is hard to enforce. It's that it's hard to **know** — and that unknowability is doing the work.
