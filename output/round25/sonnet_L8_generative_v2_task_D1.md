# Structural Diagnostic: Non-Compete Clause

---

## I. THE INITIAL CLAIM (Falsifiable)

**The deepest structural problem is that this clause conceals a maximally indeterminate restriction behind a precisely specified exception structure — directing reader attention toward what the employee *can* do in order to obscure that the employee's core obligations remain undefined.**

*Falsifiable test:* If this claim is correct, the exceptions should be measurably more precise than the restriction itself. Count defined terms in each:

| Component | Defined Terms | Undefined/Vague Terms |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Core restriction | "24 months," "2%," "12 months" | "core products," "active customers," "competes," "geographic market," "directly or indirectly" |
| Exceptions | 2%, 12 months, "written notice" | "proprietary information," "academic research," "sole discretion" |

**The restriction is structurally vague. The exceptions are structurally precise. This asymmetry is not accidental.**

## II. THREE-EXPERT COLLISION

### Expert A — Defender (Enforcement Specialist)
*"The claim holds but understates the clause's sophistication. The geographic limitation to 'active customers' is a real narrowing — courts have upheld this framing over blanket state/national bans. The salary-continuation condition in (c) shows genuine consideration. The exception structure isn't camouflage; it's what makes this clause survive judicial scrutiny in restrictive states. The vagueness in the core restriction is standard and courts fill definitional gaps via blue-penciling. This is a well-drafted clause doing what well-drafted clauses do."*

### Expert B — Attacker (Employee Rights Advocate)
*"The claim is correct but structurally shallow. Look at what the exceptions actually do upon close reading:*

- *Exception (a): 2% public securities — trivially narrow, grants nothing real*
- *Exception (b): Academic research 'provided no proprietary information is disclosed' — 'proprietary' is undefined and company-controlled, so this exception is self-negating*
- *Exception (c): The 12-month reduction reads as a benefit but is actually conditional: IF the Company pays salary, THEN the period reduces. The Company can refuse to pay, keeping the full 24-month restriction active — this exception creates an option for the Company, not a protection for the employee*
- *Exception (d): 'Sole discretion waiver' is not an exception at all — it's a control mechanism*

*Each exception, on inspection, returns power to the Company. The claim should be that the exceptions are traps dressed as protections."*

### Expert C — Prober (Contract Theory)
*"Both of you assume this clause is primarily an enforcement instrument — something the Company intends to litigate. What do you both take for granted? That the clause is designed to be triggered. But what if it's designed to deter? The definitional ambiguity isn't a drafting flaw; it's the product. An employee who cannot determine what 'core products' or 'active customers' means cannot safely take any job. That uncertainty is the mechanism. Courts don't need to enforce this clause for it to work — it works through the employee's fear of unknown scope. The question isn't 'is this enforceable?' but 'is it designed to be enforced or to be threatening?'"*

## III. THE TRANSFORMED CLAIM

After collision, the original claim transforms:

> **The deepest structural problem is that this clause functions as a deterrence instrument, not an enforcement instrument. Its definitional indeterminacies are features, not bugs — they maximize behavioral compliance through uncertainty while the exception structure provides just enough apparent reasonableness to survive judicial review *if* enforcement ever becomes necessary. The clause's primary operation occurs entirely outside litigation.**

### The Gap Between Claims

| | Original Claim | Transformed Claim |
|--|----------------|-------------------|
| **Unit of analysis** | The clause's text | The clause's behavioral operation |
| **Problem type** | Drafting asymmetry | Strategic indeterminacy |
| **Enforcement model** | Legal action | Fear of legal action |
| **Who the exceptions serve** | Appears: employee / Actually: company | Both — but the *appearance* of serving the employee is what makes the clause work |

**The gap itself is diagnostic:** The original claim assumed the clause would be read by someone trying to understand it. The transformed claim recognizes that the clause operates on someone who is *afraid* of it.

## IV. THE CONCEALMENT MECHANISM

### Named: **Precision Misdirection via Exception Architecture**

The clause conceals the indeterminacy of its core scope by making its exceptions precise and legible, exploiting a cognitive pattern: *readers assess a document's overall specificity by its most readable parts.*

**Mechanical breakdown:**
1. Core restriction is kept vague ("core products," "active customers") — maximum definitional control for Company
2. Exceptions are drafted with false precision (exact percentages, exact months) — creates impression of careful, negotiated balance
3. The "irreparable harm" and "reasonableness acknowledgment" provisions seal this by preemptively delegitimizing the employee's future claims of over-breadth
4. The sole discretion waiver (d) allows selective enforcement, which converts the uncertainty from a bug into a selective pressure tool

**The concealment mechanism works because the exceptions *feel* like evidence that someone protected the employee.** They aren't. They are the mechanism by which the illusion of protection is constructed.

## V. THE LEGITIMATE-LOOKING IMPROVEMENT THAT DEEPENS CONCEALMENT

### Proposed Amendment (would pass code review):

> *"The parties acknowledge that the scope of 'core products' and 'active customers' may not be fully determinable at execution. Accordingly, within thirty (30) days following any termination of employment, the Company shall deliver to Employee a written Restriction Notice specifying: (i) the products and services constituting 'core products' as of the termination date; (ii) the geographic markets containing 'active customers' as of the termination date. Employee's post-termination obligations shall be construed with reference to the Restriction Notice. Failure to deliver the Restriction Notice within the thirty-day period shall not waive or reduce Employee's obligations hereunder."*

### Why This Would Pass Review

- Appears to solve the definitional vagueness problem (reviewer thinks: "finally, specificity")
- Appears pro-employee (reviewer thinks: "now the employee knows what they can't do")
- Demonstrates good-faith effort at precision (reviewer thinks: "this clause just got more enforceable AND more fair")
- The final sentence looks like a standard anti-waiver protection (reviewer misses what it does)

### What It Actually Does

1. **Shifts definitional power to the post-termination moment** — when the Company knows what the employee is doing and can define "core products" to specifically cover that activity
2. **Makes the restriction MORE enforceable** by demonstrating procedural fairness that courts reward
3. **The anti-waiver tail clause** ("Failure to deliver...shall not waive") is the sharpest move: it means the Company can simply not send the notice, leaving the employee with maximum uncertainty while facing maximum obligation — the improvement *adds* a procedure and then *removes its consequences for non-compliance*

## VI. THREE PROPERTIES ONLY VISIBLE BECAUSE I TRIED TO STRENGTHEN IT

### 1. The Temporal Predation Structure
Trying to fix the definitional vagueness with a post-termination notice revealed that the vagueness is **temporally strategic**, not incidentally vague. The Company benefits maximally from defining "core products" *after* knowing what job the employee has accepted. Pre-termination definition forecloses the Company's ability to target-define. The vagueness is a placeholder for a definition that will be written against the employee's specific situation. This is only visible when you try to give the definition a deadline.

### 2. The Enforcement-Legitimacy Feedback Loop
Every structural improvement to employee protections simultaneously improves the Company's enforcement position. Making the clause *fairer* makes it *stronger*. This reveals that the clause's legal enforceability and its unfairness to the employee are not in tension — they are the same variable. You cannot improve one without worsening the other. Courts reward procedural fairness; this clause uses that reward structure against the party fairness is meant to protect. Only visible when you try to add fairness and watch it become a weapon.

### 3. The Waiver Provision as the Master Key
Provision (d) — sole discretion waiver — appeared to be a minor carve-out. Once the Restriction Notice mechanism was added, (d)'s function became visible: it allows the Company to use the precise, procedurally fair Restriction Notice mechanism *selectively*. Cooperating employees get narrow, clearly defined restrictions. Employees who leave adversarially get maximum-scope Restriction Notices — or no notice at all, with full obligations preserved. The waiver provision converts the entire framework into a **selective pressure system** that rewards compliance and punishes resistance. This is only visible when the notice mechanism gives the waiver something to operate on.

## SUMMARY DIAGNOSTIC

```
Surface structure:    Bilateral negotiated agreement with protective exceptions
Actual structure:     Unilateral control instrument with legitimizing façade
Operation mode:       Deterrence through uncertainty, not enforcement through litigation  
Concealment method:   Precision misdirection — legible exceptions hide vague obligations
Strengthening move:   Add procedural fairness (Restriction Notice)
Deepened by:          Post-termination definitional power + anti-waiver tail
Newly visible:        Temporal predation / enforcement-fairness identity / waiver as selection pressure
```

The clause doesn't hide its problems through complexity. It hides them through apparent reasonableness — the most durable concealment available.
