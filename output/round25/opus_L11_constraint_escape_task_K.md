# Structural Diagnosis of a Retry-Circuit Breaker Fusion

## The Falsifiable Claim

 The circuit breaker tracks *operation outcomes*, not *attempt outcomes*. Retries are an internal detail. The operation either succeeded-after-retries or failed-after-retries. The circuit breaker correctly tracks that.

**Prober (interrogates what both assume):** Both assume counting is the core issue. But notice: `_retry_with_backoff` calls `time.sleep()` for up to ~7 seconds total. During that window, the circuit breaker's state is **frozen**. It cannot transition, cannot reject new requests (in a concurrent context), cannot observe anything. The circuit breaker is *temporally inert* during the exact window when the most diagnostic information arrives.

### Transformed Claim

> A synchronous state machine embedded inside its own observation loop is both **informationally lossy** (undercounts failures) and **temporally inert** (unable to react during retries). The problem is not counting — it is *reactivity*.

The **gap** between the original claim (wrong count) and the transformed claim (wrong architecture) reveals that the problem is not a bug in accounting, but a consequence of the containment relationship.

---

## The Concealment Mechanism

**Abstraction boundary misplacement.**

The retry logic is a `_private` method of `CircuitBreaker`. This creates the visual impression that the circuit breaker *orchestrates* retries. In reality, it *delegates to and then ignores* them. The private method hides that `max_retries` and `base_delay` are swallowed by `**kwargs`, invisible at the `execute()` interface. The class boundary suggests control; the control flow reveals blindness.

---

## First Improvement (Designed to Deepen Concealment)

"Fix" the counting by recording each attempt failure inside the retry loop:

```python
def _retry_with_backoff(self, fn, *args, max_retries=3, base_delay=1, **kwargs):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            self._failure_count += 1          # <-- "fix": count every attempt
            self._last_failure_time = time.time()
            if self._failure_count >= self._failure_threshold:
                self._state = self.OPEN
                raise
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            delay = base_delay * (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
            time.sleep(delay)
```

This **passes code review**. The failure count now reflects reality. But it **deepens the concealment** because it makes the accounting *look* correct while making the control flow *less* coherent.

### Three Properties Visible Only Because We Strengthened It

1. **State mutation is now distributed.** Both `_retry_with_backoff` and `_on_failure()` (still called in `execute()`'s `except` block) mutate `_failure_count`. The final failure is **double-counted**. This was invisible when only `_on_failure` mutated state.

2. **The state machine has no transition guards.** Any method can set `_state` to any value. The improvement introduces a new CLOSED→OPEN transition path that races with the existing one in `_on_failure`. There is no enforcement that transitions are well-ordered.

3. **`execute()` is not compositionally safe.** If the circuit opens mid-retry, the post-retry `_on_failure()` in `execute()` records a failure against an *already-open* circuit, corrupting the failure count for the *next* recovery cycle.

---

## Diagnosing the First Improvement

**What it conceals:** The fundamental problem isn't *where* you count failures. It's that a state machine and its observation loop share a single thread. The fix makes the data look right while the *control flow* becomes contradictory.

**What property of the original it recreates:** The original problem was "the circuit breaker can't react during retries." The improvement recreates this: the circuit breaker now *reacts* mid-retry (by opening) **but can't stop the post-retry code from continuing to mutate state**. We traded *can't observe* for *observes but can't cleanly act*.

---

## Second Improvement

Unify all state mutation into a single method and check circuit state at each retry boundary:

```python
def execute(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
    if self._state == self.OPEN:
        if time.time() - self._last_failure_time > self._reset_timeout:
            self._state = self.HALF_OPEN
            self._success_count = 0
        else:
            raise CircuitOpenError("Circuit is open")
    try:
        result = self._retry_with_backoff(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        self._record_success()
        return result
    except CircuitOpenError:
        raise  # Don't record — circuit already handled it
    except Exception:
        raise  # Don't record — retry loop already handled it

def _retry_with_backoff(self, fn, *args, max_retries=3, base_delay=1, **kwargs):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        if self._state == self.OPEN:             # Check before each attempt
            raise CircuitOpenError("Circuit opened during retry")
        try:
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            self._record_failure()               # Single mutation authority
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(base_delay * (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1))

def _record_failure(self):
    """Single authority for failure state transitions."""
    self._failure_count += 1
    self._last_failure_time = time.time()
    if self._failure_count >= self._failure_threshold:
        self._state = self.OPEN
```

### Diagnosing the Second Improvement

**What it conceals:** The `self._state == self.OPEN` check at the top of the loop is **stale by the time `time.sleep()` completes.** The check and the next attempt are separated by seconds of blocking time. In any concurrent usage, the state has diverged. More fundamentally: polling state at the top of a blocking loop is not reactivity — it is the *appearance* of reactivity.

**What it recreates:** The original problem was temporal inertness. This improvement recreates it: the circuit breaker checks state at attempt boundaries, but *between* those boundaries (during sleep), it remains inert. We narrowed the blindness window but didn't eliminate it.

---

## The Structural Invariant

> **When a circuit breaker *contains* the retry mechanism, the circuit breaker's observation hooks are structurally outside the retry loop, and any attempt to move them inside creates competing state mutation paths.**

This persists through every improvement because it is a property of the **containment relationship** — not of the counting logic, the transition guards, or the polling frequency. As long as the class boundary says "I own the retry loop," the circuit breaker is either blind to retries or entangled with them.

---

## The Category Boundary

**Category: Retry-inside-breaker designs** — where the circuit breaker encapsulates the retry mechanism as a private implementation detail.

The invariant holds for every member of this category.

---

## The Adjacent Category: Peer Components with External Orchestration

Dissolve the containment relationship. Neither component owns the other. An orchestrator owns the loop:

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    """Pure state machine. No execution. No retry logic."""
    CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN = "closed", "open", "half_open"

    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, reset_timeout=30, half_open_max=3):
        self._state = self.CLOSED
        self._failure_count = 0
        self._success_count = 0
        self._failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self._reset_timeout = reset_timeout
        self._half_open_max = half_open_max
        self._last_failure_time = None

    def allow_request(self) -> bool:
        if self._state == self.CLOSED:
            return True
        if self._state == self.OPEN:
            if time.time() - self._last_failure_time > self._reset_timeout:
                self._state = self.HALF_OPEN
                self._success_count = 0
                return True
            return False
        return True  # HALF_OPEN allows probes

    def record_success(self):
        if self._state == self.HALF_OPEN:
            self._success_count += 1
            if self._success_count >= self._half_open_max:
                self._state = self.CLOSED
                self._failure_count = 0
        self._failure_count = 0

    def record_failure(self):
        self._failure_count += 1
        self._last_failure_time = time.time()
        if self._failure_count >= self._failure_threshold:
            self._state = self.OPEN


class RetryPolicy:
    """Pure schedule. No execution. No state tracking."""
    def __init__(self, max_retries=3, base_delay=1):
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.base_delay = base_delay

    def should_retry(self, attempt: int, error: Exception) -> bool:
        return attempt < self.max_retries - 1

    def delay(self, attempt: int) -> float:
        return self.base_delay * (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)


def execute_with_resilience(fn, breaker: CircuitBreaker, retry: RetryPolicy,
                            *args, **kwargs):
    """Orchestrator: owns the loop, coordinates peers."""
    attempt = 0
    while True:
        if not breaker.allow_request():
            raise CircuitOpenError("Circuit is open")
        try:
            result = fn(*args, **kwargs)
            breaker.record_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            breaker.record_failure()
            if not retry.should_retry(attempt, e) or not breaker.allow_request():
                raise
            time.sleep(retry.delay(attempt))
            attempt += 1
```

### How This Succeeds Where Every Improvement Failed

The invariant dissolves. The circuit breaker sees **every** failure. It is consulted **before every** attempt. The retry policy and circuit breaker are peers — neither is nested inside the other. There is a single mutation path for state (`record_failure` is called exactly once per attempt). The circuit can open mid-retry sequence and the very next iteration respects it. No improvement within the original category could achieve this because they all preserved the containment relationship.

---

## The New Impossibility

**Property trivial in the original category, impossible in the escape:**

In the original design, **encapsulated simplicity** is trivial:
```python
breaker = CircuitBreaker()
result = breaker.execute(my_function, arg1, arg2)
```

One object. One call. The caller doesn't know retries exist. Configuration is a single constructor.

In the adjacent category, this is **impossible.** The caller must configure two independent policies and understand their interaction:
- What happens when `max_retries=10` but `failure_threshold=3`? The circuit opens on attempt 3 and the remaining 7 retries never fire. The policies interact in ways that neither policy's documentation describes.
- You can wrap them in a `ResilientExecutor` class, but then you've recreated the containment boundary — the question is just whether the *internal* architecture preserves the peer relationship.

---

## The Finding

| | Original Category | Adjacent Category |
|---|---|---|
| **Trivial** | Encapsulated, simple API | Accurate per-attempt health model |
| **Impossible** | Accurate per-attempt health model | Self-describing configuration (policies interact non-obviously) |

**The trade-off:** You can have a **simple API that lies about system health**, or an **accurate model that exposes compositional complexity**. Every improvement within the original category was an attempt to get both — to make the circuit breaker see inside its own retry loop without dissolving the containment boundary. Each improvement moved the blindness rather than eliminating it.

The category boundary is the **containment relationship** itself. The finding is that *resilience as encapsulation* and *resilience as composition* are structurally incompatible — and every production resilience library (Hystrix, resilience4j, Polly) chose the adjacent category for exactly this reason.
