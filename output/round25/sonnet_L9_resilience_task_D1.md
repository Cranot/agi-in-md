# Structural Analysis: Non-Competition Clause

---

## I. The Initial Claim

**Falsifiable claim:** *Every apparent limitation in this clause — temporal, geographic, and subject-matter — is either undefined or controlled by the Company post-signing, making the restrictions boundless in practice while performing boundedness in text. This is verifiable: examine each limiting term and determine whether its scope is fixed at signing or expandable by the stronger party.*

---

## II. Three Expert Challenge

### Expert A — Defends

The geographic scope is the mechanism: *"any geographic market where the Company has active customers."* The Company acquires one client in Singapore; the employee cannot work there. There is no snapshot date, no definition of "active," no notice requirement. Combined with undefined "core products," the employee signed a restriction the Company can expand infinitely without amendment. Exceptions (a)–(d) perform balance while delivering none.

### Expert B — Attacks

The claim overstates. Courts routinely blue-pencil overbroad non-competes; California voids them entirely. "Active customers" would likely be interpreted at termination, not enforcement — that's basic judicial construction. Exception (c) delivers real value: paid salary during restriction is a meaningful economic concession. The "irreparable harm" stipulation is standard boilerplate courts regularly discount. This mistakes drafting aggression for a unique structural pathology.

### Expert C — Probes What Both Assume

Both experts are debating **enforceability**. But that's not where this clause operates. Its primary mechanism is *pre-litigation*. The employee reads this, believes they cannot work, and self-enforces. The clause functions whether or not it would survive judicial review, because the employee cannot afford to find out. Neither expert asks: what does this clause *do* before anyone goes to court?

---

## III. The Transformation

**Original claim:** Scope terms are Company-controlled, making limits illusory.

**Transformed claim:** *This clause is primarily a pre-litigation chilling instrument. Its operational power derives from employee uncertainty and litigation-cost asymmetry, not from legal enforceability. Company-controlled scope terms are secondary — they exist to extend and sustain uncertainty, not to create it.*

**The diagnostic gap:** I initially mistook the clause's legal architecture for its actual mechanism. The text targets courts; the operation targets employees. These are different systems.

## IV. The Concealment Mechanism: **Reasonableness Performance**

The clause displays every formal marker courts use to find non-competes enforceable:

| Marker | Apparent Function | Actual Structure |
|---|---|---|
| "24 months" | Time-bounded | Undefined trigger: "any reason" includes constructive dismissal |
| "core products" | Subject-matter limit | Undefined; Company controls product line expansion |
| "active customers" | Geographic limit | Company controls customer acquisition geography |
| Exceptions (a)–(d) | Employee protection | Each employee-favorable exception is conditioned on Company performance or discretion |
| "Employee acknowledges reasonableness" | Mutual agreement | Attempts to shift judicial standard from objective to stipulated |
| Irreparable harm stipulation | Neutral legal formality | Preemptively waives Employee's right to contest bond requirement |

**The capstone:** Exception (d) — Company may waive restrictions at "sole discretion." This reveals the structure: every exception operates as Company grace, not Employee right.

## V. The Legitimate-Looking Deepening

**Proposed improvement:** Add a definition section with a process provision.

```
For purposes of this Agreement: "Core Products" means those products 
and services listed on Schedule A, as amended from time to time upon 
thirty (30) days written notice to Employee; "Active Customers" means 
any customer from whom the Company has received revenue within the 
prior eighteen (18) months, as documented in Company records; 
"Geographic Market" means any metropolitan statistical area, region, 
or country in which Active Customers are located. The Company shall, 
upon Employee's written request, provide a written statement 
identifying then-current Core Products and Geographic Markets within 
fifteen (15) business days.
```

**Why this passes review:** Adds definitional specificity (good drafting), creates an Employee information right (appears protective), uses precise timeframes (signals careful drafting), references a Schedule (appears organized).

**Why this deepens concealment:**
- "Schedule A, as amended" converts a judicially-constrained undefined term into a *formally legitimate Company-controlled weapon* with a built-in amendment process
- "18 months" creates false precision while expanding lookback beyond what a court would likely impose
- "MSA, region, or country" gives the Company a *menu* of geographic units to invoke — whichever maximizes restriction in any given case
- The written statement process anchors litigation in Company-generated self-serving definitions that the employee has no right to dispute

## VI. Three Properties Visible Only Through Strengthening

**Property 1 — The amendment mechanism is the core weapon:**
Adding "as amended from time to time" reveals that the real danger isn't undefined scope — it's the *absence of post-signing amendment protection*. The original undefined "core products" was actually more vulnerable: courts would define it objectively at termination. The amended version with 30-day notice converts judicial construction into Company fiat. We couldn't see this until we tried to fix the definitional problem.

**Property 2 — Employee information rights are liabilities, not protections:**
The written statement provision reveals that creating formal processes for employees to *learn* their restrictions locks in Company-favorable interpretations. Before revision: employee could litigate scope without any prior Company statement. After revision: the Company's written statement creates a record that anchors litigation in Company terms. A right to receive information that only one party generates is a trap dressed as transparency.

**Property 3 — Geographic restriction works through unit-of-analysis selection, not through market definition:**
The MSA/region/country structure reveals that geographic breadth is achieved by choosing whichever unit maximizes restriction. One customer in Seattle means the entire Seattle MSA is restricted. The original clause's vagueness was actually *more* vulnerable to judicial blue-penciling than the revised clause's false precision, which provides a legitimate-sounding menu. Vagueness that courts can fill is less dangerous than precision that courts must respect.

## VII. The Engineer's Revision

An engineer who has read the complete analysis writes this:

```
NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

1. RESTRICTION. During employment and for the Restricted Period 
following the Effective Date of Termination, Employee shall not 
perform Restricted Functions for any Competing Business operating 
within the Restricted Territory.

2. DEFINITIONS.

   (a) "Restricted Period": Twelve (12) months if termination is 
   without cause AND Company pays Employee's base salary 
   continuously throughout; six (6) months for voluntary 
   resignation; twenty-four (24) months for termination for cause 
   as adjudicated, not merely asserted. Failure to make any 
   required salary payment automatically terminates the restriction 
   on the date of failure, without further notice.

   (b) "Restricted Functions": Roles that are substantially 
   identical to functions Employee actually performed in the final 
   twelve (12) months of employment, as documented in Employee's 
   last performance review and role description.

   (c) "Competing Business": Any business whose primary revenue 
   derives from products or services directly competitive with 
   Company Products listed in Schedule A. Schedule A is fixed as 
   of the Effective Date of Termination and may not be amended 
   unilaterally by Company.

   (d) "Restricted Territory": The specific geographic areas in 
   which Employee personally conducted sales, service, or customer 
   contact during the final twelve (12) months of employment, as 
   documented in Company records and confirmed in writing to 
   Employee within ten (10) business days of termination. Disputes 
   as to geographic scope shall be resolved against the drafter.

3. EXCEPTIONS.
   (a) Holdings up to 5% of publicly traded securities.
   (b) Academic research and publication.
   (c) Any employment the Company has not objected to within 
   thirty (30) days of written notice from Employee, which 
   objection shall specify with particularity the basis for 
   claimed conflict.

4. ENFORCEMENT.
   (a) Company must demonstrate actual irreparable harm in any 
   proceeding; this Agreement does not preemptively establish it.
   (b) Employee retains all rights to contest appropriateness of 
   injunctive relief, including bond requirements.
   (c) In any enforcement action, Company bears the burden of 
   proving the scope of restriction applicable at termination.
   (d) Courts are expressly authorized to modify overbroad 
   provisions to the minimum necessary scope rather than void them.

5. ACKNOWLEDGMENT. Both parties acknowledge that this restriction 
is reasonable as written. This acknowledgment does not waive 
Employee's right to contest enforceability under applicable law 
or to argue that changed circumstances render any provision 
unreasonable.
```

## VIII. Assessment: Is the Concealment Present, Transformed, or Broken?

### Broken

- Amendment weapon: eliminated (Schedule A fixed at termination)
- Geographic aggregation: eliminated (Employee's actual territory, documented)
- Exception (c) as leverage: eliminated (non-payment automatically voids restriction)
- Irreparable harm stipulation: eliminated
- Sole-discretion waiver: replaced with structured objection process
- "For cause" as classification weapon: eliminated (requires adjudication, not assertion)

### Transformed — Into a New Location

The revision introduces **"substantially identical to functions Employee actually performed"** — which requires interpretation. Who determines what's "substantially identical"? The revision has migrated definitional indeterminacy from scope and geography (where courts have developed doctrine) to *function and role* (less developed). This is a softer concealment: more constrained, still present.

### Structurally Intact — Irreducible

The transformed claim identified the deepest problem: **litigation-cost asymmetry as the operational mechanism.** Nothing in any contract clause addresses this. The Company can still threaten enforcement and the employee still faces asymmetric legal costs. That structural power differential lives beneath the text — it is a property of enforcement economics, not contract language.

**Final finding:** Text-level concealment is broken. Meta-structural concealment — the gap between what the contract says and what the enforcement economy delivers — is **irreducible by drafting.** It requires external solutions: statutory caps on non-compete duration (as in California, Minnesota, or Oklahoma), mandatory consideration requirements, or fee-shifting provisions. The clause can be made more honest; it cannot be made symmetric.
