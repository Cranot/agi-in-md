# Structural Analysis: Non-Competition Clause

---

## Step 1: The Specific, Falsifiable Claim

**Claim:** This clause's deepest structural problem is that it encodes a *one-way option disguised as a bilateral agreement*. The Company retains genuine discretion over every operative provision while extracting a fixed, unconditional commitment from the Employee. The exceptions are not employee protections—they are mechanisms that reassert company control.

This is falsifiable: if any carve-out creates an unconditional employee right not subject to company action, the claim fails.

## Step 2: The Three Experts

### Expert A — Defender
"Confirmed. Read each exception:

| Exception | Hidden Condition |
|---|---|
| (a) 2% securities | Company defines what 'competes' |
| (b) Academic research | Company defines 'proprietary' |
| (c) Reduced period | **Only if Company keeps paying** — company can void by stopping payment |
| (d) Waiver | *Sole discretion.* Full stop. |

Every carve-out has a leash. The Employee's acknowledgment of 'reasonableness' in the final sentence is a pre-loaded concession that makes the Employee a co-author of the restriction's own justification. The power asymmetry is structural, not incidental."

---

### Expert B — Attacker
"'Power asymmetry' is trivially true of all employment contracts. You've named the water, not the fish. The real problem isn't asymmetry—it's a **defect in conditional logic** that creates strategic ambiguity.

Look at exception (c): if the Company stops paying salary during an involuntary termination, does the 24-month restriction *restore*? The clause doesn't say. That's not asymmetry—that's a contradiction that is simultaneously:

- A litigation trap (courts must resolve it)
- A deterrent (Employee doesn't know which way courts will resolve it)
- A company hedge (Company can argue either outcome)

You're describing *who* holds power when you should be describing *the mechanism by which power operates*."

---

### Expert C — Prober (What do both take for granted?)
"Both of you assume this clause is trying to create *enforceable* obligations. What if enforceability is not the primary design goal?

Non-competes of this breadth are unenforceable in California, North Dakota, Minnesota, and increasingly elsewhere. A competent drafter knows this. You're both analyzing this as a legal instrument when it may primarily be a **psychological instrument**—designed to function through deterrence against employees who lack legal sophistication, not through actual enforcement.

The vagueness isn't a bug. The breadth isn't careless. The undefined terms maximize the *chilling zone*. The question to ask is: *who benefits most from ambiguity?* Not the party that wants clear enforcement—the party that wants maximum behavioral constraint at minimum legal cost."

---

## Step 3: The Transformed Claim

**Original claim:** *Power asymmetry.*

**Transformed claim:** *This clause is architected for deterrence, with deliberate unenforceability as a feature. The vague terms, undefined geography, conditioned exceptions, and pre-loaded acknowledgment are optimized to maximize behavioral constraint on legally unsophisticated employees, while the Company's retained discretion ensures that the rare enforced case is one the Company has already selected and can win.*

---

## Step 4: The Gap as Diagnostic

| Dimension | Original Claim | Transformed Claim |
|---|---|---|
| **Problem type** | Drafting defect | Design intent |
| **Primary audience** | Judge reviewing enforceability | Employee deciding whether to leave |
| **Failure mode** | Clause is unfair | Clause succeeds at its actual goal |
| **Fix** | Redraft terms | Reconceive the instrument's purpose |

**The gap reveals:** I initially read this as a poorly drafted contract. The experts forced recognition that it may be a *well-drafted instrument for an unstated purpose*. The "flaws" are load-bearing.

---

## Step 5: The Concealment Mechanism

**Name:** *Bilateralism Theater with Conditional Exception Architecture*

**How it works:**
1. **Grammatical mutuality** — "The parties agree," exceptions for Employee — creates the *appearance* of negotiated balance
2. **Exception proliferation** — four carve-outs signal careful, employee-considerate drafting, directing attention to *what* the exceptions say rather than *how* each is conditioned
3. **Pre-loaded acknowledgment** — "Employee acknowledges this is reasonable" makes the Employee an apparent co-author of the restriction's justification, immunizing it from facial challenge
4. **Definitional vagueness as chilling zone** — "core products," "active customers," "competes" have no definitions; the *breadth of unknowing* is the enforcement mechanism

**Applied:** Notice that the clause never actually defines what the Company *does*. "Core products" has no referent. This means the restriction is, in principle, infinite in scope—it can expand as the Company expands—while appearing specific because it references "core" (a limiting-sounding word with no limiting function).

---

## Step 6: Strengthening the Concealment

To make the real problem *harder to detect*, I would make three modifications:

### Modification 1: Add a Genuinely Unconditional Employee Right
> *"Employee retains all rights to inventions created entirely on personal time using non-Company resources."*

This is already the law in most states—it costs the Company nothing. But it *looks* like a real employee protection, making the bilateral framing appear substantiated. It draws attention to a category where employee rights are real, away from categories where they aren't.

### Modification 2: Define "Core Products" with Self-Referential Precision
> *"'Core Products' shall mean those products listed in Schedule A, as updated by the Company from time to time in the ordinary course of business."*

This *appears* to solve the vagueness problem—there's now a definition with a document reference. But Schedule A remains entirely within company control and can be updated to expand scope. The definition points to a moving target while appearing to point at a fixed one.

### Modification 3: Constrain the "Sole Discretion" Waiver with Process Theater
> *"The Company may waive any portion of this restriction upon written notice, provided such waiver is consistent with the Company's Non-Compete Waiver Policy as maintained by Human Resources."*

This appears to constrain arbitrary discretion with a policy framework. But the "Policy" is entirely internal, entirely mutable, and entirely within company control. The appearance of procedural constraint conceals that discretion remains absolute.

---

## Step 7: What This Tells Us About the Problem's Actual Structure

The fact that I can construct these modifications *fluently*—and that each one makes the clause *more legally sophisticated* rather than less—reveals four things:

**1. The problem is not drafting incompetence.**
Sophisticated concealment is available and easy to implement. The existing drafting is either intentional or replicable by intent.

**2. The concealment mechanism is scalable.**
There is no limit to how sophisticated the bilateralism theater can become without changing the underlying one-way structure. This means there's no "fixed" version of this clause that preserves the current power arrangement—only a *better-hidden* version.

**3. The real problem is architectural, not textual.**
You cannot fix this by improving individual provisions. Every improvement I described *adds* to the problem while appearing to solve it. The problem exists at the level of *what the instrument is for*, not *how individual clauses are worded*.

**4. The deepest problem is the gap between the stated and actual function.**
The clause presents itself as a restraint on competition. Its actual function is restraint of employee mobility through legal uncertainty. These are different objectives that require different legal and ethical analysis. The concealment mechanism works precisely by keeping that gap invisible—making the deterrent function look like the enforcement function.

**Conclusion:** This clause is most dangerous not where it is clear, but where it is *legible*. The readable parts direct attention. The structural architecture—the relationship *between* provisions—is where the real work happens.
