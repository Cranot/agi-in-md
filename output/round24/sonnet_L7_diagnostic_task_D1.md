# Structural Analysis: Non-Competition Clause

## Step 1 — The Initial Falsifiable Claim

**Claim:** The clause's deepest structural problem is that its geographic scope ("any geographic market where the Company has active customers") is deliberately undefined and self-expanding, creating a restriction that is functionally unlimited while the carve-outs (a–d) provide *illusory* relief — specifically designed to give courts "reasonable" alternatives to full invalidation rather than genuine protection to the employee.

This claim is falsifiable: if courts consistently refuse blue-penciling of similar geographic formulations, or if the carve-outs generate real enforcement limitations, the claim fails.

---

## Step 2 — The Three-Expert Dialectic

### Expert A (Defender)
The geographic scope isn't a flaw — it's sophisticated drafting. Tying restriction to "active customers" *limits* overbreadth rather than expanding it. Courts prefer this over fixed-radius clauses that arbitrarily capture non-competitive territories. The carve-outs aren't theatrical — they represent genuine negotiation artifacts: the 2% securities holding is standard, the academic exception real. The involuntary termination reduction shows authentic balance. Blue-penciling jurisdictions will *reward* this structure by finding the reducible, reasonable core.

**This defends the clause on its own stated terms.**

### Expert B (Attacker)
The geographic scope is the *wrong target*. The real failure is definitional: "core products" is undefined at the moment of signing and subject to unilateral expansion as the company evolves. Worse, provision (c) is structurally coercive — the salary continuation appears protective but actually weaponizes non-payment: if the Company simply stops paying, the employee faces a binary of compliance-without-compensation or breach-with-litigation-risk, with no mechanism to compel payment. Combined with injunctive relief without bond, the clause eliminates the only financial check on overreach. The problem isn't unenforceable vagueness — it's *selective enforceability through fear*.

**This reframes the clause as a coercion instrument, not an imprecise legal one.**

### Expert C (Probing Shared Assumptions)
Both A and B assume the clause is *trying* to function as an enforceable legal restriction and debate its success at this. That assumption conceals the real question: **what is this clause actually for?**

Trade secret law already protects proprietary information. In large jurisdictions (California, Minnesota post-2023, FTC rulemaking context), the entire non-compete is potentially void *ab initio*. If enforcement is unlikely, neither defender nor attacker explains the clause's *actual function*. Both are debating the performance's internal consistency while ignoring that it might be a different genre of performance entirely.

## Step 3 — The Transformed Claim

After the dialectic, the claim transforms:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Original** | Geographic scope is undefined and self-expanding; carve-outs are illusory relief |
| **Transformed** | The clause functions as a **threat instrument**, not an enforcement instrument — its structural "problems" are features, not bugs, calibrated to maximize chilling effect while minimizing corporate legal exposure |

The vagueness of "core products" and "active customers" is *load-bearing vagueness* — deliberately calibrated to make the employee unable to assess their own risk, not an oversight.

---

## Step 4 — The Gap as Diagnostic + The Concealment Mechanism

The gap between original and transformed claim is this: **the original evaluated the clause as if it were trying to be a well-functioning restriction. The transformed claim reveals it is trying to be a coercive instrument dressed in legal form.**

How did the clause hide this? Through a specific mechanism:

### **Concealment Mechanism: Definitional Specificity as Legitimizing Cover**

Precision in low-stakes provisions creates an illusion of rigor that *launders* strategic vagueness in high-stakes provisions.

The clause is exquisitely precise where precision costs nothing: "24 months," "2%," "12 months," "written notice." This precision signals careful, good-faith drafting. It makes the vagueness of "core products," "active customers," "directly or indirectly," and "sole discretion" appear to be unavoidable ambiguity rather than strategic weapon. The legalistic scaffolding — numbered exceptions, defined term capitalization, Latin-adjacent formality — performs the *appearance* of a balanced, negotiated instrument while embedding structural asymmetries that only function through threat, never adjudication.

## Step 5 — What the Entire Dialectic Failed to Surface

The concealment mechanism is *still hiding something* no expert touched:

### **The Acknowledgment Clause: Pre-emptive Legal Disarmament**

> *"Employee acknowledges that this restriction is reasonable in scope, duration, and geographic reach."*

This is not boilerplate. This is the most consequential sentence in the document, and the entire dialectic walked past it.

**What it does:** It converts the employee's primary *defense* in any enforcement action — reasonableness — into a *contractual stipulation*. The clause pre-forecloses the legal argument before the legal argument can be made. Courts in many jurisdictions treat such acknowledgments as admissible evidence of reasonableness, shifting the burden to the employee to overcome their own prior concession.

**What that hides — the deepest concealment:** The clause commits **category fraud**. It presents itself as a mutual agreement ("The parties agree...") between contracting entities capable of genuine negotiation. But if this is a standard employment contract presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis — which the overwhelming majority of non-competes are — then:

- "The parties agree" describes coerced assent, not negotiation
- "Employee acknowledges" is not acknowledgment but confession under economic duress
- The entire structure performs the *grammar of contract* while executing the *logic of adhesion*

The dialectic failed to surface this because all three experts accepted the document's self-description as a bilateral agreement and debated its quality as such. None questioned whether the word "parties" legitimately applies.

**The final concealment:** The clause doesn't just restrict what the employee can do after leaving. The acknowledgment clause restricts what the employee can *argue* in court. The non-compete is not only about future employment — it is a pre-litigation instrument disguised as an employment term, and its deepest function is to make the employee legally complicit in their own restraint before any harm has occurred.

## Summary Map

```
Surface Problem:    Geographic scope is vague → may be unenforceable
Dialectic Reveals: Vagueness is a feature → chilling effect is the product
Mechanism Named:   Definitional specificity launders strategic vagueness
Still Hidden:      Acknowledgment clause = pre-emptive legal disarmament
Deepest Problem:   Category fraud — adhesion contract performing as bilateral agreement
```

The clause's real architecture is: **threaten broadly, enforce selectively, and make the employee legally responsible for the reasonableness of their own constraint.**
