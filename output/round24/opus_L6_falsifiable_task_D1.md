# Structural Analysis of Non-Competition Clause

## Falsifiable Hypothesis

**Claim:** The deepest structural problem in this clause is that its geographic scope is defined by a variable the Company unilaterally controls — *"any geographic market where the Company has active customers"* — making the restriction's boundaries unknowable to the Employee at the moment of compliance, potentially expandable after termination, and therefore either void for vagueness or unconscionable in most enforcing jurisdictions.

## The Argument: Three Expert Positions

### Expert 1 (Defender) — Contract Litigation Attorney

> The claim holds. This is a **dynamically self-expanding restriction**. The Company can acquire a new customer in Tokyo the day after the Employee is terminated, and suddenly the Employee's consulting engagement in Tokyo is a breach. The Employee cannot comply with a rule whose boundaries are defined by the counterparty's future conduct. Courts in California, Colorado, Illinois, and increasingly in the post-2024 FTC landscape treat this as a hallmark of unreasonable scope. The clause doesn't say "where the Company *had* active customers at the time of termination" — it says "has," present tense, which means the restriction floats.
>
> Moreover, this dynamic scope interacts toxically with the **irreparable harm and injunctive relief without bond** provision. The Company can argue for an emergency injunction based on a geographic expansion the Employee couldn't have anticipated. The structural asymmetry isn't incidental — it's *load-bearing*. It's what makes the entire enforcement mechanism disproportionate.

### Expert 2 (Attacker) — Employment Law Scholar

> The geographic scope problem is real but **not the deepest structural problem**. Courts routinely blue-pencil or narrow geographic terms. A judge in a dispute would likely read "has" as "had at the time of termination" and move on.
>
> The deeper problem is the **internal contradiction between exceptions (c) and (d)**. Exception (c) says that in cases of involuntary termination without cause, the period reduces to 12 months *provided the Company continues paying salary*. This creates a **conditional obligation on the Company** — the restriction only binds the Employee if the Company performs. But exception (d) says the Company may waive "any portion" of the restriction at its *sole discretion*. This creates a structural question: **Can the Company invoke (d) to waive its salary obligation under (c) while keeping the 12-month restriction intact?** If so, the Employee is restricted for 12 months with no compensation. If not, what exactly does "any portion" mean?
>
> This ambiguity is more dangerous than the geographic issue because it's **hidden in the interaction between sub-clauses** and would likely not be caught until a termination event, when the Employee has the least leverage. The clause's architecture allows the Company to read (c) and (d) as granting maximum restriction with minimum obligation, while the Employee has no symmetric interpretive power.

### Expert 3 (Prober) — Legal Epistemologist

> Both arguments assume the deepest problem must be a **single identifiable defect**. I challenge that framing.
>
> What's actually happening here is a **self-reinforcing asymmetry system** — a structure where multiple individually-defensible provisions combine to create a compound effect that no single provision reveals:
>
> - The geographic scope is Company-defined → unknowable to Employee
> - The acknowledgment of "reasonableness" attempts to estop challenge → Employee pre-surrenders the right to argue the scope is unreasonable
> - Injunctive relief "without bond" removes the Company's skin in the game for enforcement → no financial risk for over-enforcement
> - Company sole discretion to waive (d) means all flexibility runs one direction → asymmetric optionality
> - The salary-continuation condition in (c) *appears* protective but is undermined by (d)
>
> The Defender identifies the most visible symptom. The Attacker identifies the most hidden interaction. But **both miss that the clause is architecturally designed so that each exception that appears to protect the Employee actually generates a new vector of Company discretion**. That's the structural pattern — not a bug, but a design.
>
> The falsifiable question is: **Is there any exception in this clause that creates a binding, non-discretionary obligation on the Company?** If the answer is no, then the clause is structurally one-sided regardless of which specific defect a court strikes down.

## What the Argument Reveals

My original claim was **partially falsified and substantially transformed**.

### What survived:
The geographic scope problem is real and legally significant. The present-tense "has" creates genuine compliance uncertainty.

### What was falsified:
It is not the *deepest* structural problem. Courts have well-developed tools to narrow geographic scope. The (c)/(d) interaction identified by Expert 2 is more structurally dangerous because it's less visible and less likely to be judicially corrected preemptively.

### What I know now that I couldn't before the argument:

The real finding is **Expert 3's structural pattern**: every exception in the clause that appears to protect the Employee is either conditional on Company action, revocable at Company discretion, or self-limiting. The exceptions don't balance the clause — they **perform** balance while architecturally preserving asymmetry.

| Exception | Apparent Protection | Structural Reality |
|---|---|---|
| (a) 2% securities | Employee can invest passively | Trivial concession; no constraint on Company |
| (b) Academic research | Employee can publish | Conditioned on "no proprietary information" — Company defines what's proprietary |
| (c) Reduced period | 12 months if terminated without cause | Only if Company continues salary — Company controls whether it performs |
| (d) Company waiver | Restriction can be lifted | Sole Company discretion — Employee cannot invoke, request, or compel |

**Revised structural diagnosis:** This clause's deepest problem is not any single defective provision but rather a **systematic architecture of illusory mutuality** — it is formally bilateral but substantively unilateral at every decision point. A court reviewing enforceability should examine the clause not provision-by-provision but as a *system*, because its one-sidedness only becomes visible at the level of interaction between provisions.
